This work employs PBCore. The PBCore (Public Broadcasting Metadata
Dictionary) was created by the public broadcasting community in the
United States of America for use by public broadcasters and others.
Initial development funding for PBCore was provided by the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting. The PBCore is built on the foundation of the
Dublin Core (ISO 15836), an international standard for resource
discovery (http://dublincore.org), and has been reviewed by the Dublin
Core Metadata Initiative Usage Board. Copyright: 2005, Corporation for

== LOCAL DEVELOPMENT SET-UP

Refer to the server set-up, but don't actually set up a server.

Some points:

* Copy a config from config/auth_rules to config/authorization_rules.rb (site-specific)

* You need to create config/application.json (see .example file)

* There's now scripts/install_required_gems.rb which will install all the dependencies needed.

* Sunspot gem versions > 1.1 do not seem to work with Rails 2.1

* Sunspot needs to be indexed and running:

 	$ rake sunspot:solr:start
	$ rake sunspot:solr:reindex
