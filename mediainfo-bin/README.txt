These files are prebuilt binaries of mediainfo. They are provided here
as a convenience only. If they don't work on your server (which is,
um, quite likely actually), you should build your own.

To build your own, visit
http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en/Download/Source
and download the 'all in one' CLI package. Untar it, go into the created
directory, and type
./CLI_Compile.sh --with-libcurl

Note that libcurl support is required for proper operation with the
PBCore database but is not available in the prebuilt binaries provided
on the mediainfo website.
